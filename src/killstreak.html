                KillStreak is a real time battle arena separated into five rounds.
                Each round is separated into Prepare Phase and Kill Phase.
                Players will be awarded points based on each round's ranking.
                After five rounds, the player with most points wins.
            </p>
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Prepare Phase</h2>
                <p class="container p-1">
                    There are three options available in the Prepare Phase: upgrading, betting, and "cheating".
                    Normally, gold is acquired by killing others in the kill phase.
                    Some amount of base gold is also awarded each turn.
                    Upgrading enables the players to get stronger.
                    Betting allows the players to bet on who will be the winner of the next round.
                    The gold is doubled if that player ended up in the first place,
                    but they lose the amount if they bet on the wrong person.
                    "Cheating" is the function where players use a great amount of gold in exchange for victory points.
                    All three operations enable different strategic plays each turn.

                <p class="container p-1">
                    In kill phase, players have ninety seconds to battle against other players.
                    At the end of the kill phase, points are awarded based on the rankings of numbers of kills.

            <h2>Game Design</h2>
            <p class="p-1">
               I am in charge of designing characters and their skills.
                Throughout the process, I want to design three characters that having a triangle countering relationship and
                one character that is a wild card. We ended up with Warrior > Assassin > Mage > Warrior, and King is the wild card.
                In economy system design, we want to balance the advantage of being skilled in the game and the advantage of
                strategic plays(e.g. tanking). We ended up with some good numbers for different rewards.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p class="p-1">
                   I implemented the "click-n-go" control system by calculating the camera distance with the ground distance,
                    transforming the clicked point from the screen space to the ground in the world space.
                    I also implemented an efficient physics system from scratch.
                    It is a variation from AABB collision testing, featuring different object shapes.
                    I choose AABB to optimize the server tick time.

                <h2>Front-End</h2>
                <p class="p-1">
                    For the front-end part, I used OpenGL to render all the special effects, including particle effects and invisibility.
                    Wrote and bind different kinds of shaders for different objects.
                    Designed and implemented all the user interfaces.

                <div class="container">
                <h2>Early Ideas Formation</h2>
                <p>We started with the idea of one shot one kill MOBA.
                    Some of us are also fans of turn based strategy games, such as Auto Chess and Civilization series.
                    We decided to give it a macro-gameplay by adding prepare phase in between kill phase.
                    To do that we need to give another kind of currency besides victory points, so we introduced gold to our game.
                    We came up with this idea of betting because we want some of kinds of investment for player who prefers to
                    snowball slowly and dominate late game, and we think betting is probably one of the most fun way to invest.
