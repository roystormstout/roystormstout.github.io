                KillStreak is a real time battle arena separated into five rounds.
                Each round is separated into Prepare Phase and Kill Phase.
                Players will be awarded points based on each round's ranking.
                After five rounds, the player with most points wins.

                <h2>Prepare Phase</h2>
                <p class="container p-3">
                    There are three operations in the Prepare Phase: upgrade, bet, and cheat. All operations require gold.
                    Normally, gold is acquired by killing others in the kill phase. Some amount of base gold is also awarded each turn.
                    Upgrade allows the players to get stronger.
                    Bet allows the players to spend any amount of gold to bet on the winner of next round. The amount is
                    doubled if they are correct, but they lose the amount if they bet on the wrong person.
                    Cheat requires more gold, as it can be used to exchange points toward victory.
                    It enables different strategies based on how the players spend their gold each turn.

                    In kill phase, players have ninety seconds to battle other players and earn gold.
                    At the end of the kill phase, points are awarded based on the rankings of numbers of kills.

                <h2>Early Ideas Formation</h2>
                <p>We started with the idea of one shot one kill MOBA.
                    Some of us are also fans of turn based strategy games, such as Auto Chess and Civilization series.
                    We decided to give it a macro-gameplay by adding prepare phase in between kill phase.
                    To do that we need to give another kind of currency besides victory points, so we introduced gold to our game.
                    We came up with this idea of betting because we want some of kinds of investment for player who prefers to
                    snowball slowly and dominate late game, and we think betting is probably one of the most fun way to invest.
